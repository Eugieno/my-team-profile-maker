## Reflection
This project was completed at the end of my 12th week at the University of Birmingham bootcamp in FE web dev. 
The main objective of this project was to convert a starter code into a working Node.js command line application that is testable, extensible, and maintainable. 

An interesting part of this challenge is that it has helped me appreciate the benefits of test-driven development. I enjoyed applying some SOLID design principles such as the Single Responsibility and Liskov substitution in developing classes and recognising others within the starter code provided. 

In summary, as a result of this project, I am now familiar with the fundamentals of TDD with node.js. Looking ahead, I will be building applications of this kinds/form from scratch. 

## Upcoming (New) Features
In the immediate future, I plan to include the following features to extend the functionality and UI/UX of this CLI app.
* More child classes to extend the template of possible professional profile that can be generated. Currently, only 3 exist, The Manager, Engineer and Intern.
